### **Mr. Ramli Bin Puteh: A SIWA’s Thirst for Learning**<br>

IMDA and the Peoples’ Association Active Ageing Council (PAAAC) appoint new Silver Infocomm Wellness Ambassadors (SIWA) every year. SIWAs are seniors in the community who lead a digitally savvy lifestyle and have a passion to impart that knowledge to their peers. In 2019, 36 new SIWAs were appointed, and over 200 have been appointed to date.

We caught up with one of 2019’s SIWA Appointments, 66-year-old Mr. Ramli Bin Puteh, to learn about his journey and what inspired him to share his knowledge with the community.
