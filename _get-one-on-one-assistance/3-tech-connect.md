Tech Connect is a collaboration among the Ministry of Communications (MCI), Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), and the People’s Association (PA), to provide one-on-one assistance to residents who need help in using their digital devices and services. This service is free and is currently available at 48 Community Clubs/Centres (CCs). CCs offering the Tech Connect service will have a decal showing the words “Tech Connect #ShowMeHow” at their main entrance.
