## Helping Seniors Use Their Smartphones<br>

**At IMDA's Digital Clinics, corporate volunteers give back to society by providing dedicated assistance to seniors on their smartphone queries.**<br>

In the last few months, 36-year-old Ryan Yeo has made some new friends. When seniors get in touch with him by email, they thank him for helping them navigate their smartphones and make plans to meet him again. For Ryan, these sentiments are the rewards of volunteering at the Digital Clinics organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).<br>  

Ryan, a full time Technical Service Consultant from Government Technology Agency (GovTech), is one of the numerous volunteers at these clinics where they provide one-on-one assistance to anyone who needs help with using their smartphones and mobile devices.<br>

Most of the participants, including seniors, visit these clinics to learn how to optimise their smartphones, navigate apps, and connect better with their friends and family through social media or messaging platforms.<br>

The Digital Clinics are free and held regularly in public libraries and community spaces for all age groups.<br>

**Mr Selvaraj Antonyrai**, 30, Digital Clinic Volunteer<br>

Like Ryan, Selvaraj Antonyrai is a Digital Clinic volunteer and was inspired to contribute since he is an experienced IT professional. “I deal with the mobile platform at work every day,” said the 30-year-old Software Development Lead at Standard Chartered Bank. “So I’m familiar with it and can help seniors with their questions.” <br>

One senior who has benefitted from the Digital Clinic programme is 78-year-old Joyce Shum. “I came here because I wanted help with clearing some mobile apps that I don’t use. I tried doing it myself, but I had difficulties and I wasn’t sure what I was doing wrong,” she said.<br>

The volunteer guided Joyce through the steps on how to remove unwanted apps and also helped installed the Chinese keyboard on her smartphone. “Sometimes, my friends would text me in Chinese, but until now, I could only reply in English because I didn’t know how to set up the Chinese keyboard” she added. The session was so
fruitful for her, that she even learnt how to send emails and share information across a broader platform.<br>

Volunteering at these Digital Clinics is an option available to organisations that are part of IMDA’s SG:D Friends programme. SG:D Friends is an initiative that encourages organisations from private, people and public sectors to amplify Singapore’s Digital Readiness efforts by reaching out to the community to equip them with digital skills. “This is the first time I’m volunteering and I’ll definitely do it again,” said Selvaraj. “I think it’s very useful for seniors, especially for them to learn the basics of mobile security, like setting a passcode for their phones. In instances like that, the senior walks out of the clinic with a more secured mobile device.”<br>
